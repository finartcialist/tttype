Type and Trade and Type : TTType

## What is TTType ?

TTType is an esolang plugin. It is in nature esoteric, although it can technically be a plugin for any kind of programming language.

The goal of TTType is add a market constraint to the act of programming, or typing. Every reserved word of a programming language becomes an object to be traded on the market in TTType. The programmer needs to buy and sell the reserved words in order to maintain a portfolio, to be used in the creation of a program.

It is an arts project whose goal is to explore the concept of markets as a creative constraint and as a medium.

*Note*: the market in the current version of TTType is a **simulation**. Random numbers are generated and used as values for the reserved words.

### Markets as a medium

Can we use markets as a way to create collaborative, anonymous works of art ? Are markets able to say something for themselves? Is it possible to gain inspiration from markets ?

These are all questions I wish to explore with the finartcialist project ( [link to finartcialist project](https://finartcialist.com) ).

### Markets as a constraint

Markets can also act a constraint - not every type of paint has the same price, e.g. Can these constraints lead to creative work ? My inspiration stems from creative, constrainted writing, like the OuLiPo.

## Next steps for TTTYpe

* implement leadeboard(s) based on the highest portfolio value, or on the number of programs that were achieved and runned.
* write a better intro and an essay about the project
